    <p className="mb-4">Welcome to SalOcean Harmony, a project dedicated to addressing the pressing issue of imbalanced ocean salinity. Our oceans are the lifeblood of our planet, but human activities are causing a shift in their delicate balance. Industrial processes, pollution, and climate change are all contributing to an increase in ocean salinity. This imbalance is not just a problem for marine life; it has far-reaching effects on our global climate as well.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Imbalanced ocean salinity can exacerbate global warming and lead to more extreme weather events. As the salinity increases, it affects the ocean’s ability to absorb heat and carbon dioxide, two key factors in global warming. This can lead to a vicious cycle, where increased global warming further increases ocean salinity. Moreover, changes in ocean salinity can alter ocean currents, which can lead to more frequent and severe storms.</p>

<p className="mb-4">The goal of SalOcean Harmony is to increase public understanding of this issue and influence policies to address it. We believe that with greater awareness and understanding, we can drive meaningful change. Our project is backed by scientific data, which clearly shows how human activities have caused this issue and its relationship to several factors in climate change.</p>

<p className="mb-4">SalOcean Harmony is an open-source project, inviting contributions from all who are interested in preserving our oceans and our planet. We believe in the power of collective action and the importance of transparency, which is why all our data and findings are freely available for everyone to access and contribute to.</p>

<p className="mb-4">One of the key features of our project that you’ll interact with is an interactive map. This map allows you to visualize the changes in ocean salinity across the globe. As you navigate this map, you’ll see firsthand how ocean salinity levels have changed over time and identify the areas most affected by this issue. But that’s not all. The map also layers in data on extreme storm severity and global warming, showing you how these three factors interact and change over time. This comprehensive view helps you understand the complex interplay between these environmental factors and the scale of their impact. We hope this tool empowers you to gain a deeper understanding of these issues and inspires action towards their mitigation.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Join us in our mission to restore the harmony of our oceans. Together, we can make a difference.</p>
