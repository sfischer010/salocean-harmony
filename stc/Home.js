    <p className="mb-4">Welcome to SalOcean Harmony, where we tackle the critical challenge of rising ocean salinity due to human activities like pollution and climate change. This imbalance threatens marine ecosystems and escalates global warming by hindering the ocean's heat and carbon absorption, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle of climate impact.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Our mission is to enlighten the public and influence policy-making through scientific evidence that demonstrates the human contribution to this problem and its broader climate implications. SalOcean Harmony is a collaborative, open-source project that values transparency and collective effort, offering accessible data and findings for public contribution and scrutiny.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Soon you will be able to engage with our interactive global map to see the changing salinity levels and their correlation with extreme weather patterns and warming trends. This tool will illustrate the significant interplay between these factors and their collective impact on our environment. Join us in our commitment to restoring the ocean's harmony and mitigating these pressing environmental issues.</p>
